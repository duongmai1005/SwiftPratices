# If you created a ViewController before and now you want to create a XIB file associated with the ViewController. Follow these steps below.

1. First create a XIB file. We should name the XIB file the same as the ViewController we want to connect for better categorising.
2. Open the XIB file and look for File's Owner section.
3. Click on File's Owner section, on the right hand side look for Custom Class section. Put the ViewController class to the Class field to connect.
4. After that, navigate to Outlet section, drag the outlet of the View to the View in XIB file.
5. Save and enjoy.
